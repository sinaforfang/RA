Run the notebook galtonbox.ipynb to redo the Galton board simulations done on various n and N. Run the notebook calculating_mse.ipynb to see the mse calculated between the pdf of the normal distribution and the probaility mass function of the binomial distribution. My result is still saved, so it's possible to see the results without running the code.
